# PLEASE READ BEFORE EDITING!

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) is required for generating the website.

Do **NOT** edit the HTML files. These will be overwritten by the script in scripts/generate.sh. Instead, edit the markdown files in src/

For CSS editing, it will be in style\ sheets/

For Javascript editing, it will be in scripts/js/

It is advised that you become familiar with Git, and clone this git repository instead of editing the files on the server directly. That way, you can edit all of the files locally on your machine and when the changes are satisfactory to your liking, you can then push them back to the server. Then, when needed, can be pulled onto the active web server on site at LOLP. Here is a walkthrough of how to use [git](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html)

On top of that, it also allows us to have multiple mirrors of the source code in case anything happens to our server wiping the data.
