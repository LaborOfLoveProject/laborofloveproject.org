Good day esteemed potential adopters. You can call me God. Just kidding, Church is fine. I am looking for a family to worship me... I mean share my love with. (Can someone ask my foster mom if I'm doing this thing right? She says I'm a little self-centered). I don't think it's too much to ask for endless love and affection and to be your one and only! 

I cry at empty cat bowls and when I feel neglected. I really do prefer to be an only child. Dogs have too much energy and cats, well, what can I say. I'm very selective in which of my foster siblings I tolerate on which days. I love head scratches and even allow baths! Who can say that about their cat? Think of the credit you'll get at gatherings with that.

I really enjoy being your center of attention. I also do okay with toddlers but may prefer an older, less tail-grabbing age. Also, please don't be alarmed, I am missing a back toe. It builds character. If it seems like I'd be a good match for you, have your people call my people. Let's plan something.
