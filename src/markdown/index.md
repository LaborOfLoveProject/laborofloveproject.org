# Major Work in Progress
This website is currently heavily under active development. Please note that this website is not going to look decent for a while until we hammer down on the CSS and Javascript. As far as the CSS goes, we are looking into incorporating [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a professional, and modern looking website.

Our plans are to incorporate photos and videos from our [nextcloud](https://nextcloud.laborofloveproject.org) sub-site to dynamically update to display our current and new fosters and rescues.

Additionally, we plan on incorporating [ONVIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONVIF) streams for our boarded animals, as well as incorporating sensors to smart-switch our cameras (when purchased) so those boarding will be able to see their animals at all time, including in pitch-black darkness with the IR LED's.

We are commited to being 100% open source, and you will be able to view our source code at our [Github](https://github.com/LaborOfLoveProject)


### [Donate](donate.html)
Rescue is difficult and it never ends. Help us help animals in need
through a donation to our PayPal, or donate goods like food or toys by
contacting us. We also need your time! Donate volunteer hours and join
us on the front lines.

### [Volunteer](volunteer.html)
We are always in need of new fosters to \#BeTheBridge between the
shelter and forever. What you might not know isÂ that we also need
drivers to help us get animals to vet appointments and transport
meet-ups, as well as community ambassadors!

### [Featured Foster](featured-foster.html)
Not all of our animals are adoptable; many are already promised to
rescue groups all over the nation. However, we do always have some
animals that are available for local adoption. We like to highlight them
here so you can fall in love with them as we have!
