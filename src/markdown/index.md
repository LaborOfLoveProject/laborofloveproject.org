### [Donate](donate.html)
Rescue is difficult and it never ends. Help us help animals in need
through a donation to our PayPal, or donate goods like food or toys by
contacting us. We also need your time! Donate volunteer hours and join
us on the front lines.

### [Volunteer](volunteer.html)
We are always in need of new fosters to \#BeTheBridge between the
shelter and forever. What you might not know isÂ that we also need
drivers to help us get animals to vet appointments and transport
meet-ups, as well as community ambassadors!

### [Featured Foster](featured-foster.html)
Not all of our animals are adoptable; many are already promised to
rescue groups all over the nation. However, we do always have some
animals that are available for local adoption. We like to highlight them
here so you can fall in love with them as we have!
